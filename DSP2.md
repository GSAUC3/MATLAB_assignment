1. Discrete rectangular function
a. Find out the convolution of ùë•[ùëõ] with itself numerically and by matrix method in your notebook.

answer:
```Matlab

To be done in notebook
```
b. Create a discrete rectangular pulse as shown ùë•[ùëõ]= [ 1 1 1 1 1‚Üë], where the arrowed element represents n = 0. Perform the operation in MATLAB using 'conv' function and plot ùë•[ùëõ] and the convolution in the same graph.

answer:
```Matlab
n=-10:1:10;
y=(n>=-2)-(n>=3);
stem(n,y);
grid on
xlabel('Discrete time samples [n]');
ylabel('x[n]');
title('Discrete Rectangular pulse');
%Convolution of the Discrete Rectangular Pulse with Itself - 
c=conv(y,y,'same'); %conv(u,v,'same') returns only the central part of the convolution, the same size as u
stem(n,y,'r');

2. Convolution with delta function
a. Deduce the output function for an input ùë•[ùëõ] convolved with discrete delta function ùõø[ùëõ] (in your notebook).

answer:
```Matlab
To be done in notebook
```
b. Create a discrete Gaussian function and a shifted discrete delta function and perform their convolution operation in MATLAB. (Hint. ‚Äògaussmf‚Äô).

answer:
```Matlab

n=-10:1:10;
g=gaussmf(n,[5,0]); 
%f(x;œÉ,c)=e^[‚àí(x‚àíc)^2/2œÉ^2]
%To specify the standard deviation, œÉ, and mean, c, for the Gaussian function, use params.

% Shifted Delta Function
n=-10:1:10;
y=dirac(n-2); %d = dirac(x) represents the Dirac delta function of x.

y(index)=1;

c. Create a discrete pulse train (comb function) and find out the convolution of it with the Gaussian. Use ‚Äòpulstran‚Äô to create pulse train.

answer:
```Matlab
%Let the pulse train repeats itslef with a frequency 0.5Hz, the signal lasts
%for 60 seconds, and the samplerate is 1 KHz. The gain  factor is a
%sinusoidal of frequency 0.05 Hz. 
%Generating the pulsetrian
t = 0:1/1e3:60;
d = [0:2:60;sin(2*pi*0.05*(0:2:60))]';
x = @rectpuls;

%Discrete Gaussian Function
n=-10:1:10;
g=gaussmf(n,[5,0]); %This function computes fuzzy membership values using a Gaussian membership function. You can also compute this membership function using a fismf object. y = gaussmf(x,params) returns fuzzy membership values computed using the following Gaussian membership function:
%f(x;œÉ,c)=e^[‚àí(x‚àíc)^2/2œÉ^2]
%To specify the standard deviation, œÉ, and mean, c, for the Gaussian function, use params.

3. Correlation
a. Create two 1D vectors [1 2 3 4] and [4 3 2 1] and calculate their correlation.

answer:
```Matlab
x=[1 2 3 4];
y=[4 3 2 1];
a=xcorr(x,y);
stem(a);
xlabel('Values');
title('Correlation of x and Y vector');
grid on
```
b. Perform the correlation using ‚Äòxcorr‚Äô in MATLAB. How would you be able to perform convolution using ‚Äòxcorr‚Äô function

answer:
```Matlab
% As we know r = xcorr(x,y) returns the cross-correlation of two discrete-time sequences. 
%Cross-correlation measures the similarity between a vector x and shifted (lagged) copies 
%of a vector y as a function of the lag. If x and y have different lengths, the function appends
%zeros to the end of the shorter vector so it has the same length as the other.
%Convolution using ‚Äòxcorr‚Äô- Convolution using xcorr function is possible along with certain
%limitation. We know from the definition of xcorr function that
%xcorr(x,y)=conv(x,fliplr(y))
%where fliplr(y) returns the flipped version of a certain vector y , it may be any vector x or y ,
%but the limitation is the vector must be two dimensional otherwise the axis of flip need to
%be defined. So we can define the flipped version of the function that we
%want to convolve with the another function and use the xcorr function to flip it again and essentially perform convolution.
